       "### 1. Pipeline description\n",
       "\n",
       "My pipeline consisted of these steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "#### 1. Convert images to HLS color model.\n",
       "#### 2. Apply 'Canny' algorithm for saturation channel.\n",
       "Goal is to detect lines on images with different brightness or images with shadows.\n",
       "![alt text][canny]\n",
       "#### 3. Region of interest. Select edges only in defined trapezoidal region.\n",
       "![alt text][roi]\n",
       "#### 4. Hough lines. Detect lines in ROI and suppress noised lines by threshold.\n",
       "![alt text][hough_lines]\n",
       "#### 5. Extrapolate hough lines and draw rulers. \n",
       "![alt text][ruler]\n",
       "In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() in following way:\n",
       "  - Calculate tangents for each hough line\n",
       "  - Separate lines by tangents to left and right candidates\n",
       "  - Draw candidates on binary image\n",
       "  - Find coords of white points on binary image by ```np.nonzero()```\n",
       "  - Apply polynomial regression for these coordinates by ```np.polyfit(x, y, degree)```. \n",
       "Now i have parameters ```m``` and ```b``` for line equation ```y=mx+b```\n",
       "  - Draw each line by found equation\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. Potential shortcomings\n",
       "- Cars with yellow or white colors appears in ROI\n",
       "- Road turns in sharp angle\n",
       "- Snow on the road\n",
       "- Signs drawn on the road\n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. Possible improvements of pipeline\n",
       "\n",
       "- Stabilize slope and bias of found rulers by running means. You can see that running mean even with 5 last frames cuts off noisy peaks.\n",
       "![alt text][running_means]\n",
       "\n",
       "- Canny algorithm detects edges by 2 Sobel's operators: one for vertical edges, second for horizontal edges. Possible improvement would be to extend it to detect sloping edges. Similar techniques widely used in convolution layers of neural nets.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Canny algorithm takes 2-D picture as input. Possible improvements would be to analyze RGB (or HLS) channels simultaneously by 3-D version of Sobel's operator\n",
       "\n",
       "- We know shape of lane line: rectangle. Don't find edges - find rectangles. Possible solution is to draw yellow and white rectangles, apply homography transformation for these rectangles: with different angles, different scales. And find positions of these transformed rectangles on the picture by cross correlation algorithm.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The opposite way is to rectify whole image from camera by homography transformation. Find short lane lines by simple algorithm, we know they are parallel (in most of cases :) ). Now we have at least 4 points to rectify plane along these lane lines. Then find rectangles by cross corellation in rectified plane to have more precise location of lane lines.\n",
